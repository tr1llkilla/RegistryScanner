This program is only meant to provide a thorough registry search. It is not intended to delete any files from a system. Files from a user's system
registry should be carefully analyzed in order to properly remove only the desired program/s ie.. Riot Client. Upon running the program, files containing 
each search term will be listed in the terminal. (Open Regeditor as an Administrator) The user can than manually search (Click 'Computer' then press 'Ctrl+f') their registry
for exact file names containing said search terms and choose whether or not to delete them. The program can be modified to search for any amount of singleterm 
keywords within the users system. The program won't search for files outside of the registry. 

The program is really good for registry forensic and data analysis purposes. It allows for more functionality and precision for the search (Ctrl+f) function within Regeditor.
